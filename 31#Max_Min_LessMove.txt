31. Given a array find a min and max value in less than 2*(N-2) comparison

- if we take first value as min and max and now comparison will all the other values then its 2*N -2 moves

- when we compare in pairs,
a,b first compare which is min and which is max and now compare it with actual min and max.
it makes 3*(n/2) (3 moves for N/2 elements) == 1.5 N

- when we compare triplets - its 5*(n/3) == 1.66N
