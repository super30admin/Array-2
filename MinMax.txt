To find the minimum and maximum of a given array of numbers, 
we need a minimum of 2n-2 comparisons. (n-1 for min, n-1 for max).

However, we could solve it in 1.5n-2 comparisons in the following way.

1. Divide the given array pair wise. (that is each subarray has just 2 elements)
2. Between these two elements, just one comparison is enough to know the local min and local max.
3. Now, one comparison is required to compare with global min.
4. One to compare with global max.
5. So, for every pair of elements, we need a maximum of 3 comparisons.
6. So, in total we'll have 3(n/2) - 2 comparisons to find the min and max of the whole array.
