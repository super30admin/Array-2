#Given an array of numbers of length N, find both the minimum and maximum. 
#Follow up : Can you do it using less than 2 * (N - 2) comparison

Input = [4,3,2,7,3,2,3,1]
# take two variable max and min
#to compare 
#take element in pair and compare with each other 
# check which is greater within the pair and finds the min and max element between then
# comapre with max element with max and min element with min variable
# Number of Comparision is 3n/2 as number of elemets tos earch reduce to N/2 and three comparision are done
