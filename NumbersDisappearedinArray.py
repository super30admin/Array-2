# Time Complexity : O(N)

# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
# Any problem you faced while coding this : No

# Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
# Since the constraints given are in the range 1 â‰¤ a[i] â‰¤ n,
# the intuition is to make the values at the index negative.
# Then check if the numbers in array are greater than zero and apeend it to output array
