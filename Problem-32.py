#Time complexity -O(M*N)
#space complexity -O(1)
# Approach - after counting thelive cells based on rules live cell that is going to be dead is replaced with -1 and dead cell that is going to be alive is replaced with 2. In the end -1 is replaced with 0 and 2 is replaced with 1.

#didn't pass the test cases. Have to figure it out for the error.
