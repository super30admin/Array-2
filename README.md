# Array-2

## Problem1 (https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-numbers-disappeared-in-an-array/)


## Problem2
Given an array of numbers of length N, find both the minimum and maximum. Follow up : Can you do it using less than 2 * (N - 2) comparison -- if we compare pairs, then we have N/2 pairs and in each pair, first we get the min of the pair(comparison 1), say pairMin, then we compare pairMin with current min and update accordingly (comparison 2), and lastly we compare pairMax with current max and update accordingly (comparison 3), thereby making the total number of comparisons to be 3N/2
