Problem: Disappeared Number
Time Complexity : O(n)
Space Complexity : O(1)
Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : yes
Any problem you faced while coding this : no

Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
We make the value at idx negative if the value exists, then retrieve all +ve indexes

Problem: Game of Life
Time Complexity : O(n^2)
Space Complexity : O(1)
Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : yes
Any problem you faced while coding this : no

Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
We check all the neighbors of each elem and replace them with a temp variable if their state is changing based on the
given constraints, then replace the temp var with actual value

Problem: Find Minimum and Maximum in Array
Time Complexity : O(n)
Space Complexity : O(2)
Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : yes
Any problem you faced while coding this : no

Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
To reduce the number of compares, we check 2 elements at once and get the local max and min. Thus, iterating we get min
max.
