'''
Time complexity: O(m*n) because we traverse through the matrix
Space Complexity: O(1) because we are not using any extra space --> smae board and only res variable for count that keeps updating
Leetcode: Sucess!
Problem: None. Just developing the concept a little. understanding at the countLives.
